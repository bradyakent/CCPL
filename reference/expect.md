Undocumented Functions and Variables

Below are the undocumented symbols in this module.

***If an exported function or variable shows up here, please be a good person and document it.***

Documentation is important. Don't make other people dig through your source code to figure out what something does.

### `expect`
***Undocumented***
```lua
local function expect(index, variable, ...)
```
